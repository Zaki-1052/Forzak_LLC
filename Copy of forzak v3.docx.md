**Key Personnel**

Sameer Alibhai is the Company's President & CEO. Sameer is an MBA graduate from Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied corporate finance and entrepreneurial studies. After completing his MBA in May 1999, he joined Bureen Financial Management Corporation, a management consulting firm in the Greater Toronto area. Some of his experiences include providing seed capital, accounting and general consulting expertise to high-growth companies in the Greater Toronto Area. He has also assisted senior management at client companies to conduct corporate reorganizations as well as preparing company profile and valuation reports, in preparing companies for various mergers and acquisitions. During this time, Sameer was instrumental in raising CAD$50 million for various clients across sectors. Many of these companies went on to become industry leaders.

In May 2001, Sameer left Bureen to launch his own consulting company. In September 2001, Sameer raised CAD1$ million for a startup software company based in Toronto, Canada and joined the company as its CFO. Over the next two years, the company reached sales of CAD$4.5 million and was eventually acquired by a large US-based software company. This transaction returned over 500% to the investors. Sameer invested in additional private placement investments which returned over 400% over a three-year period.

In January 2004, Sameer began consulting at Industrial Textiles Limited \- the family business. Sameer conducted a large corporate reorganization resulting in greater efficiencies and increased profitability. Sameer also managed to diversify the company's supplier base and customer base while streamlining the company's products.

In September 2004, Sameer moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to expand the family business across the GCC.  Sameer opened offices in Dubai and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.  These initiatives increased the company’s sales and profitability by over 250% over a two-year period.  These businesses continue to this day and have greatly expanded the customer base of the company.

In January 2010, Sameer moved to Los Angeles to focus on managing the company’s assets and invested in several privately-held and public companies.


## **2\. Page Layout & Formatting (Page 1\)**

* **Overall Layout:** The page uses a clean, professional, three-column grid structure for its main content, though the columns are not explicitly bordered. The top of the page is reserved for a header area, and the bottom contains a page number. The background of the entire page appears to be a very light, subtle grey or off-white with a faint, abstract, smoky or brushed texture, giving it a slight gradient effect that is darker at the bottom and lighter at the top.  
* **Header:**  
  * The top right corner features the company's logo and name, "FORZAK LLC". We will have to come up with a new logo for Forzak LLC.    
  * The main page title, "ABOUT US", is located below the header area, left-aligned. It's rendered in a large, bold, sans-serif font.  
* **Text & Columns:**  
  * The body text is a standard serif font, likely Times New Roman or a similar classic typeface.  
  * The content is divided into logical sections using bolded, sans-serif headings ("Services \- Consulting", "Financial Investments", "Key Personnel").  
  * The "Services" and "Financial Investments" sections use bulleted lists for clarity.  
  * The text is generally left-aligned. The introductory paragraph spans the full width of the content area, while the two "Services" sections are arranged side-by-side, occupying the left and middle portions of the page below the introduction. The "Key Personnel" section spans the full width below that.  
* **Color Scheme:** The palette is corporate and conservative. The text is black. The headings are a slightly lighter shade of black or very dark grey. The only strong color comes from the central image. All main sub-headings in this document (second level) are a bolded blue. All bullet point symbols are also this standard professional blue color.  
* **Footer:** A circular element with the page number "03" is visible at the bottom right, suggesting this is the third page of the full printed document.

## **3\. Image Descriptions (Page 1\)**

**Main Image (Center of Page)**

* **Placement:** The image is centrally located on the page, positioned to the right of the "Services" and "Financial Investments" bulleted lists. It breaks the text flow and serves as the main visual anchor.  
* **Subject:** A professional, corporate group portrait of five colleagues (three women, two men) in a modern office setting. They appear to be a diverse team of young professionals, likely in their late 20s to mid-30s.  
* **Composition:** The group is arranged in a slightly staggered, triangular formation, facing the viewer. A blonde woman is at the forefront, her arms crossed confidently. She is flanked and backed by her colleagues, who are smiling warmly. The shot is a medium shot, capturing them from the waist up. The background is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the team.  
* **Lighting & Mood:** The lighting is bright, even, and professional, suggesting a well-lit office environment. The mood is positive, collaborative, and confident. The subjects' expressions are friendly and approachable.  
* **Attire:** The individuals are dressed in business casual to business professional attire.  
  * The central woman wears a light blue, collared, button-up shirt.  
  * The man to her right (viewer's left) wears a light-colored dress shirt.  
  * The woman to his right wears a black top under a dark blazer.  
  * The woman to the central woman's left wears a black blazer.  
  * The man in the back right wears a light-colored dress shirt with a patterned tie.  
* **Background:** The background is a generic, modern office interior with what appears to be a dark blue wall or partition directly behind the group, and lighter architectural elements further in the background. The shallow depth of field blurs the specifics, keeping the focus entirely on the people.  
* **Overall Impression:** The image is intended to project professionalism, teamwork, diversity, and competence. It's a classic stock photo choice for a corporate "About Us" page, meant to give a human face to the company.

## **2\. Page Layout & Formatting (Page 2\)**

* **Overall Layout:** The page maintains the same visual identity as the first, with the identical header, background texture, and typography.  
* **Structure:** Unlike the first page, this page follows a simpler, single-column layout. The text content flows as a series of full-width paragraphs, detailing the biographies of the company's key personnel.  
* **Text:** The fonts (sans-serif for headings, serif for body) and colors (black text) are consistent with the previous page. The names of the personnel being introduced are bolded for emphasis within the paragraphs.  
* **Footer:** The page number "04" is displayed in a circular element, this time positioned in the bottom-left corner.

## **3\. Image Descriptions (Page 2\)**

**Main Image (Bottom of Page)**

* **Placement:** The image is located at the very bottom of the page, underneath all the biographical text. It serves as a concluding visual element for the "About Us" section.  
* **Subject:** A close-up, symbolic photograph of a firm handshake between two individuals, signifying a business deal or agreement.  
* **Composition:** The frame is tightly focused on the two clasped hands, with the background heavily blurred. The handshake is the undeniable focal point. The camera angle is slightly low, making the handshake appear solid and significant. We see the cuffs of the individuals' sleeves but not their faces.  
* **Details:** One individual is wearing a dark, pinstriped suit jacket with a crisp white dress shirt cuff visible. The other individual's attire is less distinct but appears to be a similar dark business suit. The handshake is firm and professional.  
* **Lighting & Mood:** The lighting is bright and clear, typical of a well-lit indoor office or boardroom setting. The mood is one of professionalism, trust, partnership, and successful negotiation. It is a very formal and classic corporate image.  
* **Background:** The out-of-focus background suggests a professional setting. The glossy, reflective surface of a boardroom table can be discerned, along with the faint, blurred shapes of empty office chairs. The use of a shallow depth of field ensures the background does not distract from the symbolic action in the foreground.  
* **Overall Impression:** This is a quintessential "deal-closing" image, chosen to visually represent the company's function in finance, mergers, and building strong business partnerships.

## **2\. Page Layout & Formatting (Page 3\)**

* **Overall Layout:** This page continues the established brand identity with the same header (logo and company name on top right) and subtle textured background. The structure is a two-column layout: the main text content is on the left, and a large image occupies the right-hand side, starting about a third of the way down the page.  
* **Header:** Identical to previous pages, with the "Forzak" logo and "FORZAK LLC name in the top right.

This mix of serif and sans-serif for headings adds some typographic variety.  
* **Lists & Bullets:** The page makes extensive use of lists. A unique design element is the use of a right-pointing triangle (➤) as a primary bullet point for main categories. Sub-points under "Core Values" use a traditional circular bullet. This creates a clear visual hierarchy.  
* **Footer:** The page number "05" is centered at the bottom in a circular element.

## **3\. Image Descriptions (Page 3\)**

**Main Image (Right Side of Page)**

* **Placement:** The image is vertically oriented and placed on the right side of the page, aligned with the lists under "Core Values", "Creativity & Rigour", etc.  
* **Subject:** An intense, focused business consultation between two men at a modern office desk or boardroom table.  
* **Composition:** The shot is a medium close-up, focusing on a dark-haired man in a suit who is actively speaking and gesturing with his hands. He is the primary subject. We see the back of the head and shoulder of the person he is speaking to (the client or colleague), which creates a sense of being in the meeting. The speaker is on the right side of the image, and his hands are in the center, drawing the viewer's eye.  
* **Main Subject Details:** The man appears to be in his 30s, with dark hair, and is wearing a dark suit, a crisp white shirt, and a red patterned tie. His expression is serious and engaged, and his hands are open and animated as if he is passionately explaining a complex financial concept or strategy.  
* **Lighting & Mood:** The lighting is professional and directional, highlighting the speaker's face and hands. The mood is one of serious, high-stakes business, expertise, and persuasive communication. It conveys a sense of authority and deep knowledge.  
* **Background:** The background is an office environment, but it is artfully blurred. We can make out the vertical lines of a window blind and the general shape of a plant, but no details are clear. The focus is kept entirely on the interaction at the table.  
* **Overall Impression:** This image is chosen to project expertise, active advisory, and personalized client engagement. It visualizes the "consulting" and "advisory" services described in the text, portraying the company's representatives as dynamic, knowledgeable professionals.

**\[Sub-heading\]**

**Private Equity**

**\[Paragraph\]**

Forzak targets the capital and financial advisory requirements of high-growth, profitable  businesses.  
➤ Forzak can make direct investments of up to $1 million, either in its own capacity 'on balance sheet' or by arranging a syndicate of investors.  
➤ Investments can be for either new capital or the sale of existing shares.  
➤ Forzak takes an active interest in its investments and is specifically looking to identify investment opportunities where it can add value beyond simply the provision of capital.  
➤ Forzak has a flexible investment mandate in respect to industry; however, it will not make an investment in a business that has not proven the commercial potential of its product or service. Invariably, this requires existing product or service revenues and, if the business is not currently profitable, the ability to identify a clear path to profitability.  
➤ Forzak looks to make long-term investments in businesses with outstanding commercial prospects, and accordingly, anticipates making a small number of investments each year.  
**\[Sub-heading\]**

**Private Placements**

**\[Paragraph\]**

In structuring and raising capital, Forzak can:  
➤ Advise on the optimal capital structure  
➤ Present the investment opportunity to investors in a clear and concise manner  
➤ Determine the universe of likely potential investors  
➤ Represent the client in the private placement market  
➤ Create a competitive environment  
➤ Negotiate the most favorable terms available  
➤ Oversee the documentation process  
**\[Paragraph\]**

The sale of corporate debt or equity to one or more of a limited group of investors can be an attractive means to raising capital. Private placements can be handled more expeditiously than other available alternatives, often at a lower cost to the issuer and with a higher level of confidentiality and flexibility.

**Faint Background Image**

* **Placement:** This image serves as a full-page background, sitting behind all the text content like a watermark. It is faded and has a slight blue or cool grey tint.  
* **Subject:** A businessman in a professional suit, seen from the chest up, extending his right hand forward as if to initiate a handshake.  
* **Composition:** The man is on the right side of the frame, and his extended arm and hand project towards the center-left of the page. The shot is a medium close-up, but because it's a faded background element, it doesn't dominate the page. The focus is soft.  
* **Details:** The man is wearing a dark navy or black business suit, a light-colored dress shirt (likely white or light blue), and a tie. His posture is confident and open. The gesture is the central, symbolic action of the image.  
* **Lighting & Mood:** The lighting on the original photo appears professional, but it has been rendered as a low-opacity, monochromatic overlay. This creates a subtle, corporate texture for the page without interfering with the readability of the text. The mood it adds is one of professionalism, partnership, and being ready to do business.  
* **Overall Impression:** This background image reinforces the company's brand themes of creating partnerships, making deals, and being client-focused. The handshake gesture is a powerful, universal symbol of agreement and trust, which is highly relevant to the "Financial Investments" described in the text.

**Main Image (Bottom of Page)**

* **Placement:** The image is a wide, panoramic-style shot that sits at the bottom of the page, acting as a visual base for the content.  
* **Subject:** A conceptual financial image featuring a pie chart made of shiny, golden coins, with one slice being separated from the rest.  
* **Composition:** The shot is a close-up, looking down at a slight angle onto a dark, reflective surface where the chart rests. The pie chart is the central focus. It is composed of what appear to be stacked, milled-edge gold coins. A single slice, representing about one-quarter of the chart, is pulled out and away from the main circle. In the background, there are additional stacks of golden coins of varying heights, all slightly out of focus.  
* **Lighting & Mood:** The lighting is dramatic and warm, with strong highlights gleaming off the metallic surfaces of the coins and the chart. The background is dark, making the gold elements pop. The mood is one of wealth, assets, division of capital, and strategic financial allocation.  
* **Details:** The coins are rendered to look like real gold, with a high polish and detailed edges. The pie chart has clear, sharp dividing lines. The dark surface it sits on reflects the golden light.  
* **Overall Impression:** This image is a powerful visual metaphor for the financial concepts discussed on the page, such as "Management Buyouts" (taking a slice of the company), "Financial Restructuring," and "Partial divestiture." It visually represents the division of assets, shareholder value, and the creation of wealth.

**Debtor-in-possession Financing**

**\[Sub-heading\]**

**Asset Based Financing \- When You Need More Than A Bank**

**\[Paragraphs\]**

At Forzak we make it possible for companies to finance their businesses with secure loans. Unlike banks that rely heavily on balance sheet ratios and cash flow projections as loan criteria, at Forzak we use a client's business assets as our primary basis for lending. The result is usually far greater borrowing power than can be achieved from a traditional banking approach.

This type of financing can carry companies over difficult economic cycles, enabling them to strengthen their financial position, grow and achieve their ultimate goals. While companies come to us with their borrowing needs for many reasons, perhaps the most important aspect of our approach is that prospective borrowers do not have to be profitable or have a minimum net worth. A business with tangible assets and competent management can use its assets to create additional working funds to help carry out its business plan.

Our loan facilities can be backed by many types of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and certain tangibles.

Asset based financing has enjoyed remarkable growth within the banking world. What was once considered a minor part of financial services now rivals traditional banking in the most vibrant part of the American economy, the middle market. The theory of asset based lending \- matching a company's assets to its borrowing needs \- has passed several tests.

* Asset based lenders have been reliable and supportive to companies in need of financing during difficult economic times.  
* Asset based lenders have provided loan packages well above the $300 million range.  
* Asset based lenders today serve almost every sector of North American industry and every geographic area.

Our straightforward approach to business can be summed up in three words \- Listening ... Learning ... Lending.
