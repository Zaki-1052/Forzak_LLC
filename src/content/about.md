## Key Personnel

**Sameer Alibhai** – President & CEO

Sameer is an MBA graduate from Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied corporate finance and entrepreneurial studies. After completing his MBA in May 1999, he joined Bureen Financial Management Corporation, a management consulting firm in the Greater Toronto area. Some of his experiences include providing seed capital, accounting and general consulting expertise to high-growth companies in the Greater Toronto Area. He has also assisted senior management at client companies to conduct corporate reorganizations as well as preparing company profile and valuation reports, in preparing companies for various mergers and acquisitions. During this time, Sameer was instrumental in raising CAD $50 million for various clients across sectors. Many of these companies went on to become industry leaders.

In May 2001, Sameer left Bureen to launch his own consulting company. In September 2001, Sameer raised CAD1 $ million for a startup software company based in Toronto, Canada and joined the company as its CFO. Over the next two years, the company reached sales of CAD $4.5 million and was eventually acquired by a large US-based software company. This transaction returned over 500% to the investors. Sameer invested in additional private placement investments which returned over 400% over a three-year period.

In January 2004, Sameer began consulting at Industrial Textiles Limited – the family business. Sameer conducted a large corporate reorganization resulting in greater efficiencies and increased profitability. Sameer also managed to diversify the company's supplier base and customer base while streamlining the company's products.

In September 2004, Sameer moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to expand the family business across the GCC. Sameer opened offices in Dubai and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. These initiatives increased the company’s sales and profitability by over 250% over a two-year period. These businesses continue to this day and have greatly expanded the customer base of the company.

In January 2010, Sameer moved to Los Angeles to focus on managing the company’s assets and invested in several privately-held and public companies.

Sameer is mainly responsible for the management consulting side of the business as well as overseeing all other aspects of the company, including managing the Company’s and family’s assets.
