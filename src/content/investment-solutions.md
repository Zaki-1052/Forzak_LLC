# Investment Solutions

## Tailored Financial Solutions for Your Business

Forzak LLC offers a comprehensive suite of investment banking and financing solutions designed to meet the unique needs of businesses across various stages of growth. From private equity investments to specialized financing structures, we provide the expertise and capital access necessary to achieve your strategic objectives.

## Private Equity

Forzak targets the capital and financial advisory requirements of high-growth, profitable businesses.

- Forzak can make direct investments of up to \$1 million, either in its own capacity 'on balance sheet' or by arranging a syndicate of investors.
- Investments can be for either new capital or the sale of existing shares.
- Forzak takes an active interest in its investments and is specifically looking to identify investment opportunities where it can add value beyond simply the provision of capital.
- Forzak has a flexible investment mandate in respect to industry; however, it will not make an investment in a business that has not proven the commercial potential of its product or service. Invariably, this requires existing product or service revenues and, if the business is not currently profitable, the ability to identify a clear path to profitability.
- Forzak looks to make long-term investments in businesses with outstanding commercial prospects, and accordingly, anticipates making a small number of investments each year.

## Private Placements

Forzak structures and arranges private placements of debt and equity capital with select institutional investors.

In structuring and raising capital, Forzak can:

- Advise on the optimal capital structure
- Present the investment opportunity to investors in a clear and concise manner
- Determine the universe of likely potential investors
- Represent the client in the private placement market
- Create a competitive environment
- Negotiate the most favorable terms available
- Oversee the documentation process

The sale of corporate debt or equity to one or more of a limited group of investors can be an attractive means to raising capital. Private placements can be handled more expeditiously than other available alternatives, often at a lower cost to the issuer and with a higher level of confidentiality and flexibility.

### Our Company:

- Is constantly involved in the private capital markets, thus we provide real-time knowledge of the private capital market and the constantly changing market conditions to our clients.
- Can help companies achieve the most favorable pricing and terms available in the market for senior debt, mezzanine (or subordinated) debt financing and equity capital.
- Possesses extensive knowledge of, and has relationships with, key financial decision makers at a wide variety of financing sources.
- Can give an honest and accurate view of the market to provide clients with the highest probability of a successful closing.

## Management Buyouts

A management buyout gives entrepreneurial managers a chance to own a significant portion of and control an established business.

- Control their destiny
- Enhance their ownership – become owners
- Create wealth for themselves

In addition, management buyouts allow investors to participate with owner/managers in a dedicated, carefully structured enterprise focused on creating wealth. Forzak works with clients to enable selling owners to achieve fair value when divesting of ownership.

## Financial Restructuring

Forzak concentrates its investment banking resources on smaller-sized transactions ranging in value from \$500,000 to \$5 million.

Forzak works with clients through the numerous complex issues, which arise in distressed situations. Our experience with traditional mergers & acquisitions in a variety of industries and our extensive background in advising companies through bankruptcy and restructuring situations represents the core of our comprehensive distressed merger and acquisition service offering. Forzak has a proven background of assisting our clients in negotiating and closing the most complex transactions.

Forzak has extensive experience assisting smaller-market companies restructure their operations. We work with clients to quickly source interim financing often working within the restrictive timelines imposed by the bankruptcy process or litigious settings.

Forzak works with clients to ensure the successful completion of the restructuring process. Several options exist to allow a company to successfully emerge from a distressed situation including:

- Sale of the company
- Partial divestiture
- Recapitalization with permanent sources of financing

## Debtor-in-Possession Financing

A critical element of a company in bankruptcy proceedings is Debtor in Possession ("DIP") financing. Forzak will work with clients and lenders to negotiate the appropriate terms and covenants to ensure a successful restructuring and reorganization of a company. We work with legal, accounting and audit professionals to ensure that DIP financing allows a company to successfully emerge from bankruptcy and achieve its business goals.

Services include real estate project financing across senior, mezzanine debt as well as equity funding. The business specializes in creating full finance solutions for clients encompassing development finance, acquisition and repositioning, tailored financing and structuring complex transactions, actively participating and investing in joint ventures with clients, managing and sharing project risk.

## Asset Based Financing – When You Need More Than A Bank

At Forzak we make it possible for companies to finance their businesses with secure loans. Unlike banks that rely heavily on balance sheet ratios and cash flow projections as loan criteria, at Forzak we use a client's business assets as our primary basis for lending. The result is usually far greater borrowing power than can be achieved from a traditional banking approach.

This type of financing can carry companies over difficult economic cycles, enabling them to strengthen their financial position, grow and achieve their ultimate goals. While companies come to us with their borrowing needs for many reasons, perhaps the most important aspect of our approach is that prospective borrowers do not have to be profitable or have a minimum net worth. A business with tangible assets and competent management can use its assets to create additional working funds to help carry out its business plan.

Our loan facilities can be backed by many types of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and certain tangibles.

Asset based financing has enjoyed remarkable growth within the banking world. What was once considered a minor part of financial services now rivals traditional banking in the most vibrant part of the American economy, the middle market. The theory of asset based lending – matching a company's assets to its borrowing needs – has passed several tests.

- Asset based lenders have been reliable and supportive to companies in need of financing during difficult economic times.
- Asset based lenders have provided loan packages well above the \$300 million range.
- Asset based lenders today serve almost every sector of North American industry and every geographic area.

Our straightforward approach to business can be summed up in three words – ***Listening ... Learning ... Lending*****.**
